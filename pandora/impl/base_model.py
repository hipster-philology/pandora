        Parameters
        ===========
        train_in : dict
            A dictionary with input data that has at least
            one of the following keys:
                * 'X_focus': focus token representation
                    at the character-level. This should hold a
                    numpy array (np.int32) of shape:
                    (nb_samples, token_len) where each token is
                    represented by integer indices corresponding
                    to the original characters (padded to a uniform length).
                * 'X_contexts': representation of the token-level
                    context (right and left concatenated). This should
                    hold a numpy matrix (np.int32) of shape:
                    (nb_samples, nb left_context words + nb right context words).
                    Each instance is represented by integer indices
                    corresponding to the original tokens
                    (padded to a uniform length if necessary).

        train_out : dict
            A dictionary with output data that has at least
            one of the following keys:
                * 'X_lemma': representation of the lemma.
                  * If include_lemma is 'generate', this representation
                    will be at the character-level and the value
                    should be a matrix of shape:
                    (nb_samples, lemma_len, nb_characters). Each target
                    should thus be a binary matrix representation
                    of the output lemma.
                  * If include_lemma is 'label', the target lemmas
                    are represented as atomic labels using a binary
                    matrix of shape: (nb_samples, nb_lemmas).
                * 'X_pos': representation of the pos tags
                  in a binary matrix of shape (nb_samples, nb_tags).
                * 'X_morph': representation of the morph tags
                  in a binary matrix of shape (nb_samples, nb_tags).
